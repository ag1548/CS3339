 *  1. Will this code compile? Which parts of the code seem problematic?
 *
 *  2. What does the sizeof() function return? Have you ever had to use it?
 *
 *  3. From a programmer's perspective, what is the difference between int and long?
 *
 *  4. From a programmer's perspective, what is the difference between long and long long?
 *
 *  5. Write down what you expect from each line of output. Then compile and run the code and
 *     check if your guesses are correct.
